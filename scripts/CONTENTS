                        Directory Contents - scripts/

  These are the example scripts that come with eggdrop.  They're meant to be
  useful AND to introduce Tcl to those who haven't dealt with it before. Even
  people who program in Tcl may be confused by Eggdrop's implementation at
  first, because so many commands were added to interface with the bot.

  action.fix.tcl
    Gets rid of those ugly /me's people do instead of a .me.

  alltools.tcl
    Several useful procs for use in scripts.

  autobotchk
    Tcl script used to crontab your Eggdrop. Type 'scripts/autobotchk' from the
    Eggdrop's root directory for help.

  botchk
    A shell script which can be used for auto-starting the bot via 'cron'.

  compat.tcl
    Maps old Tcl functions to new ones, for lazy people who can't be bothered
    updating their scripts.
