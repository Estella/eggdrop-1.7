  What's new? First, read the following documents:

    INSTALL
    README
    doc/BOTNET
    doc/UPDATES1.7
    doc/TCL-COMMANDS

  All of these documents combined will fill you in on the latest changes to
  Eggdrop in version 1.7.x. All files, with the exception of UPDATES1.7, are
  also available in html format in doc/html/.

  A lot of things have changed in this version, so at a minimum, read the
  UPDATES1.7 text file. UPDATES shows what's been added and fixed along the
  way.


  Changes made to Eggdrop 1.7.x from Eggdrop1.6.x:

<To be formatted later; just a list of major changes for now. -Wcc>

    * HTTP proxy support has been added.

    * The 'strict-host' config setting is gone. A new setting, 'strict-ident'
      has been added in it's place. This setting, when enabled, makes the bot
      see ALL ident prefixes as '~'. For example, wcc!+wcc@eggheads.org would
      be seen as wcc!~@eggheads.org to the bot. See doc/settings/mod.server
      for more details.

    * A new 'e' logging flag has been added to log Tcl errors.

    * The 'require-p' and 'log-time' config settings have been removed.
