  What's new? First, read the following documents:

    INSTALL
    README
    doc/BOTNET
    doc/UPDATES1.7
    doc/tcl-commands.doc

  All of these documents combined will fill you in on the latest changes to
  Eggdrop in version 1.7.x. All files, with the exception of UPDATES1.7, are
  also available in html format in doc/html/.

  A lot of things have changed in this version, so at a minimum, read the
  UPDATES1.7 text file. UPDATES shows what's been added and fixed along the
  way.

  If you are upgrading from a pre-1.6 version of Eggdrop:

    1. Before you start the bot for the first time, BACKUP your userfile.

    2. DON'T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE. MAKE A NEW ONE!
